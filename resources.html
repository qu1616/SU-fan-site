        <h1>Resource Information</h1>
        
        <p>On the website, the Steven Universe Fansite logo with the picture was kind of created from scratch. I simply used one of the best scenes from the movie and added the Steven Universe logo to it. In addition, to make it more fitting for the site, I added the word "fansite" to the logo. I had to edit it to make it like it was part of the logo. Furthermore, I added extra text to the photo to make clear on what the site is about.</p>
        
        <p>Embedded media was used on two different pages on the site. It was used on the Homepage with a Youtube video and on the Music page with a GIF of Steven and the Crystal Gems.</p>
        
        <p>The pictures of the soundtracks on the music page use the image rollover effects.</p>
        
        <p>Javascript was used on the Characters page. On this page, it's used for Steven and Rose/Pink Diamond. The reasoning for this is because those specific characters have multiple designs, therefore, the Javascript helps view both of those pictures. This enhances the site by allowing the viewer to see the updated design of those specific characters.</p>
        
        <p>Something that was done extra was typing out every episode. This took me at least half an hour to find each episode and type it into a tag. I also added a rollover feature to more than one image.</p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <p>Out of all the projects I did this semester, I am the most proud of this one. I believe I did a lot of things well. One factor that was done well was the content. As a big fan of Steven Universe, coming up with the content was the easiest part for me. I knew exactly how to word everything and I knew what information would be necessary for a fansite. Another factor that was done well was the media. As simple as it may seem, I think embedding a Youtube video to the site made it more exciting. The video shows a clip of a brand new season that many fans are excited about; it's a great way to enhance the site for the fans. Lastly, I think a great job on the design of the logo. I created the logo in photoshop and it looks very professional. The text and the picture look amazing together and I believe it helped the website look more pleasing. </p>
        
        <p>Although I did many things good, there is always room for improvement. One factor that could have been improved was the overall design. I really wanted to use a grid but the only I could not make it consistent so instead I decided to use a regular website layout. It still looks fine but personally, I'm not impressed with the overall design. Another thing that could have been improved is the color scheme. I did look for a color scheme online to use but I only used 3 out of the 4 of the colors. I feel like a better variety of colors could have been used because the site does look pretty bland; even with the color.</p>
